# FontViewer - Building Your First macOS App

Dear readers, let me welcome you and start by saying that this tutorial is the beginning of a new journey and new explorations, as itâ€™s the first of a series of tutorials on a new topic: macOS programming!

Developing for macOS and creating desktop applications is a wonderful process if you want to go down that road. If you are coming from an iOS background like me, then you will find exciting and challenging at the same time to be able to make apps for both systems. What makes it even better is one simple fact: There are lots of common things between iOS and macOS programming. Several frameworks and SDKs, the language itself (Swift), even the coding style that one has used to remain almost the same. But macOS programming is not meant for people being iOS developers already. New programmers who have started learning Swift and they want to make their own desktop applications can follow along as well!
